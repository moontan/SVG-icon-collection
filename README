This is a simple collection of SVG-logos (inkscape SVG, an XML format) which may be exported as a PNG file (≤512px*≤512px, using inkscape, for instance) and used as icons for fluid.app, a software that opens your frequently used websites in an SSB (site specific browser, fantastic way to keep the number of open tabs/windows in your other browsers at a manageable level).

Not all of the images are what everyone might call super pretty so everyone feel free to contribute and propose your own edits here.
